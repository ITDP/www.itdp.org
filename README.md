ITDP.org HQ website theme, plugins, and widgets

## How to use these files

1. Install the Genesis Framework. See readme-themes.txt for details.
2. Install and activate the ITDP Responsive child theme. This theme is contained within this repository. FYI, your website will look terrible if you preview the theme before you complete the remaining steps, but don't worry -- you'll have it looking much better soon.
3. Install and activate plugins. You'll need to install the plugins contained in this repository, as well as a few third-party plugins listed here: readme-third-party-plugins.txt
4. Configure Genesis. See readme-genesis-settings.txt for details.
5. Add text widgets with your local translations. See readme-widgets.txt for details.

And that's it.
